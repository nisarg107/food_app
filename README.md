# foodapp

I have developed a comprehensive food app using Flutter. It allows users and restaurants to register and login through an authentication API. Uniquely, users and restaurants have separate interfaces. Users can browse and order food, while restaurants have a dedicated profile page potentially for managing menus, showcasing themselves, or striking business deals. Stripe integration seamlessly handles payments within the app. This multi-faceted app caters to both sides of the food service equation. This innovative design caters to both sides of the food service industry, all wrapped up in a user-friendly and visually appealing UI/UX experience.
